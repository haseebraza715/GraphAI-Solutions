## Introduction

This project focuses on solving various graph-based problems, leveraging AI principles and algorithmic problem-solving techniques. The repository includes implementations for:
- Finding the **shortest path** in a graph
- Solving variations of the **Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)**
- Exploring optimization techniques for graph traversal and analysis

## Features
- **Graph Construction:** Build graphs from input data with nodes and edges.
- **Shortest Path Algorithms:** Find the shortest path between nodes using Dijkstra's or other algorithms.
- **Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP):** Implement multiple approaches to solving or approximating TSP.
- **Optimizations:** Explore different techniques to optimize graph traversal and pathfinding.

## Technologies
- **Python 3.x**
- **NetworkX** for graph data structures
- **NumPy** for numerical computations
- **Matplotlib** for visualizations (optional)
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for interactive problem-solving

## Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/graph-algorithms-for-ai.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd graph-algorithms-for-ai
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Open the relevant Jupyter notebooks or Python files for different graph problems.
2. Run the algorithms to explore shortest path solutions, TSP variations, and other graph-based optimizations.

### Example:
To run a shortest path algorithm, use the following command inside your Python environment:
```bash
python shortest_path.py
```

For the Jupyter notebook versions, launch the notebook server:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
